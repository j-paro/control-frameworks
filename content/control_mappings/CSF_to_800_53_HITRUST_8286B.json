Because the priority reflects an order of precedence, the highest priority risks may not always be those with the greatest exposure value. Since risk response has not yet been determined, priority is not necessarily a reflection of the chronological order in which risk should be mitigated. Ultimately, the relative priority of various types of risk must be decided upon by those with appropriate authority, usually through guidance provided through the risk management strategy. That strategy and the resulting internal guidance are interpreted at each level (such as by application at the system level in the CSRR) and may then be adjusted as risk management activities are reported and monitored (as illustrated in Figure 2). In this way, those in the enterprise who are accountable for cybersecurity oversight (e.g., a Chief Information Security Officer) establish priorities for cybersecurity risks and collaborate with other enterprise executive colleagues regarding how risk will be managed in the context of other enterprise risks.",

    "Reference_Document_Element_Description" : "After having calculated the risk exposure resulting from each risk in the CSRR, as detailed in NISTIR 8286A, the next step in the process is to determine their relative priority. Because the priority reflects an order of precedence, the highest priority risks may not always be those with the greatest exposure value. Since risk response has not yet been determined, priority is not necessarily a reflection of the chronological order in which risk should be mitigated. Ultimately, the relative priority of various types of risk must be decided upon by those with appropriate authority, usually through guidance provided through the risk management strategy. That strategy and the resulting internal guidance are interpreted at each level (such as by application at the system level in the CSRR) and may then be adjusted as risk management activities are reported and monitored (as illustrated in Figure 2). In this way, those in the enterprise who are accountable for cybersecurity oversight (e.g., a Chief Information Security Officer) establish priorities for cybersecurity risks and collaborate with other enterprise executive colleagues regarding how risk will be managed in the context of other enterprise risks.",

The CSRR is used to record and communicate various cybersecurity risk considerations that support the ERM process. Guidance throughout this series references stakeholders at various levels, with senior leaders defining ERM scope, context, and strategy at enterprise levels, and others providing management and implementation throughout that enterprise. Senior leaders also establish a risk appetite that sets the tone and, where possible, a quantified range for how risk – including cybersecurity risk – will be handled within the enterprise. The risk appetite is interpreted at enterprise and organizational levels and, in turn, helps to define the risk tolerance for specific risks, types of risk, or performance benchmarks. Tolerance – the acceptable level of variation that management is willing to allow­ – describes the acceptable level of performance risk in accordance with the stated risk appetite.",

Risk response selection is an important element of maintaining an appropriate balance among value, risk, and resources. Risk response should result in residual risk levels that fulfill the risk appetite and risk tolerance directives provided in previous activities. Enterprise risk strategy often describes levels of authority regarding who may approve risk treatment decisions. For example, the selection and approval of controls for a system that has been confirmed to be low impact may generally be approved by the system owner. As the potential impact of risk consequences increases, the level of coordination and oversight usually increases. Because these levels may vary greatly, levels of authority must be well defined by a role as part of the ERM policy and process.",

    "Strength_of_Relationship" : "",
    "Reference_Document_Element_Description" : "Numerous factors (e.g., financial loss, enterprise reputation, shareholder sentiment) influence priority and should be included in the enterprise risk strategy. A cybersecurity risk that directly impacts the mission is likely to be a high priority, but many other considerations – such as agency or corporate reputation – might move a particular type of risk to the top of the list. Another consideration might occur if a corporate entity were preparing for a merger. The community has seen recent examples that have demonstrated that the discovery of a cybersecurity risk can affect the valuation of an enterprise and subsequent negotiations. There may also be factors that are not directly related to security but that might support organizational improvement (e.g., quick wins that will build team confidence and gain momentum, risks related to an objective that leaders have established as a key priority). Priority values such as low, moderate, and high are often used as risk prioritization categories. For example, this is the convention used for categorizing federal systems as described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 and 200. This qualitative approach may be more limiting than quantitative analysis in that it is easier to sort a range of numerical values, even those that are relatively close than it is to sort a list of risks marked “Very High.” In most enterprises, risk strategy should provide direction for both generalization (e.g., low, moderate, high) and more specific risk prioritization methods.",

Specific processes for bringing this information together are described in NISTIR 8286C, but several foundational definitions are relevant to properly prioritizing risk at each stage of the life cycle, including aggregating and prioritizing CSRR data discussed in this document: ·       Risk aggregation – the combination of several risks into one risk to develop a more complete understanding of the overall risk [ISO 73 definition] ·       Risk criteria – terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated, such as organizational objectives, internal/external context, and mandatory requirements (e.g., standards, laws, policies) [ISO 73 definition] ·       Risk optimization – a risk-related process to minimize negative and maximize positive consequences and their respective probabilities; risk optimization depends on risk criteria, including costs and legal requirements [ENISA definition] [8]",

Risk response selection is an important element of maintaining an appropriate balance among value, risk, and resources. Risk response should result in residual risk levels that fulfill the risk appetite and risk tolerance directives provided in previous activities. Enterprise risk strategy often describes levels of authority regarding who may approve risk treatment decisions. For example, the selection and approval of controls for a system that has been confirmed to be low impact may generally be approved by the system owner. As the potential impact of risk consequences increases, the level of coordination and oversight usually increases. Because these levels may vary greatly, levels of authority must be well defined by a role as part of the ERM policy and process.",
